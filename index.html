        <img id="IMG_8581.HEIC" src="image.jpg" alt="IMG_8581.HEIC">
            
            <p> We had some early Art of what the game is going to be and look like after final product but some of the ideas and plans during the gaming process was challengeing so we decide to scrap those of early versions of the game but also the story to along with the characters. </p>
            
            <img id="IMG_8582.HEIC" src="IMG_8582.jpg" alt="IMG_8582.HEIC">
            
            <p> The one thing that i learned is that game development takes a along time of planning and making behind the scenes of the games that we played and seen during childhood to now. The one thing we couldn't done differently is we should have fix the story and charcaters up mostly. </p>
             
        <h2> Scratch Game </h2>

            <p> Your Objective is to catch as many fishes you can from the sky in a FishNado The Character you play as is Steve </p>
            
            <p> I was going to change the fish and scuba diver into something else when i counldn't find out the name of my game and what type of game i want it in. I picking some different things at once until i got the idea before i even switch the fish and scuba out and decide to call Fishnado of my game where theres this giant Tornado full of fishes like the movie sharknado and scubas object is to eat all fish he can </p>
            
            <p> I learn Sometimes we need to go Threw processing of gaming development even thought this was just on scratch website it took me a long time to even come up with a game myself and also how Video Game Designs and Developments take and the one i couldn't done differently was maybe add more things until i send out the final product but i didnt have enought time to do it. </p>
